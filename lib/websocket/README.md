# WebSocket client

This mostly a copy/paste of `WebSocketClient` class implementation from https://github.com/theturtle32/WebSocket-Node/ project.

The reason to copy/paste instead of NPMâ€™ing is to get rid of native extension required by `node-websocket`, which may cause issue for client distribution.
